# Usage
This is the usage if you want to clone game's files to your pc

1. try to clone my repository :
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/yassinedevop/The-Word-Game
</pre>

2. change the name from `The-Word-Game` to `the_word_game` because flutter doesn't allow the usage of `uppercases` and `-` for package names

3. open your cmd and check that you are in the folder that we clone than run this command :
<pre> flutter create . </pre>
 
this command will generate all the necessary files to be able to build the app
